Then, the tokens are delegated to validators, and they start earning interest. This interest (staking rewards) is then used to generate prizes for the users on a larger scale than what each user could get individually.<br /><br />To ensure the safety and security of the deposited funds, Cosmos Millions delegates to some of the most reliable validators in the Interchain. You can leave a Cosmos Millions pool at any time and your tokens will be sent back to your wallet.',
